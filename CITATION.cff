  This repository implements the Woodell & Abrahamson (2014)
  and Woodell (2018) aftershock classification algorithm,
  now adopted in the NGA-West3 project. The method builds on
  the traditional timeâ€“distance window approach of Gardner &
  Knopoff, but introduces three alternative distance-window
  metrics that reference the actual rupture plane geometry
  rather than a fixed circular distance from the epicenter.
  By retaining the original time-window formulation while
  redefining the spatial window, the algorithm provides a
  more accurate and reproducible classification of mainshock
  versus aftershock events. This refinement was first
  applied to the NGA-West2 Ground-Motion Database and has
  since become the standard in NGA projects. The code here
  enables researchers to apply the method to their own
  earthquake catalogs, ensuring consistency with the
  NGA-West3 framework and supporting transparent,
  reproducible seismic hazard analyses.
